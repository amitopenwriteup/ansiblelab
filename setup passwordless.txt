Scenario

example [These are the dummy ip address for explanation purpose]

Local Machine (Your computer): 192.168.1.100
Remote Machine (Server): 192.168.1.200
User on Remote Machine: remoteuser [you can use root]

Steps

1. Generate an SSH Key Pair on the Local Machine On your local machine (192.168.1.100), generate the key pair:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 

When prompted, press Enter to accept the default file location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) and passphrase leave it blank for passwordless access.

This creates two files:
Private key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa (keep this secure, never share it)
Public key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (this will be shared with the remote machine)

2. Copy the Public Key to the Remote Machine

Transfer the public key from the local machine to the remote machine at 192.168.1.200 under the user remoteuser:
ssh-copy-id labuser@192.168.1.200

This command copies your public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the remote machine and adds it to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of the remoteuser.

If ssh-copy-id is not available, use this manual method:

Copy the public key to the remote machine:

scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remoteuser@192.168.1.200:/tmp/id_rsa.pub

Log in to the remote machine:

ssh remoteuser@192.168.1.200

Append the public key to the authorized_keys file:

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
cat /tmp/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
rm /tmp/id_rsa.pub

3. Test the Passwordless Connection

From the local machine, connect to the remote machine:

ssh remoteuser@192.168.1.200
